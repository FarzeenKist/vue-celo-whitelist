# BUILDING A CELO WHITELIST DAPP USING VUE.JS
A whitelist dapp built on the celo blockchain using Vue.js for giving users early access to any services(could be early access to an NFT collection, a marketplace etc).

### Introduction
Celo was designed to enable a new universe of financial solutions accessible for mobile users, creating a global financial ecosystem where an end-user can onboard into the Celo ecosystem with just a mobile number. It offers the following key features
- Layer-1 protocol
- EVM compatible
- Proof-of-stake
- Carbon negative
- Mobile-first identity
- Ultra-light clients
- Localized stablecoins (cUSD, cEUR, cREAL)
- Gas payable in multiple currencies

### Requirements
- Writing the smart contract and deploying it on the celo blockchain using RemixIDE. Access should be given to the first 15 users for free who want to get in.
- There should be a website where people can go and enter into the whitelist. We will use Vue.js to build it and interact with our smart contract

Lets start building ğŸš€

### Prerequisites
- You can write code in Vue.js
- Have celo extension wallet installed and set up. If not, install [CeloExtensionWallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/celoextensionwallet/kkilomkmpmkbdnfelcpgckmpcaemjcdh?hl=en) from Google Chrome store
- Nodejs installed on your machine.
- An IDE such as Vscode or Sublime text.
- Remix IDE.
- Command line or similar software installed.

### Building The Smart Contract
Now it's time to create a Solidity smart contract.
You can use any editor you like to make the contract. However, for this part of the tutorial we recommend the online IDE [RemixIDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
1.  Go to Remix
![Remix IDE](https://github.com/ozo-vehe/vue-celo-whitelist/remixIDE.png) 
2.  Check out the "Solidity Compiler", and "Deploy and Run Transactions" tabs. If they are not present, enable them in the plugin manager
3.  Create a new solidity file in remix, named mood.sol
4.  Write the contract

4.1 Specify the solidity version and add a license 
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;
```


4.2 Define the contract
```solidity
contract Whitelist {
  // This is the contract's body, here you'll specify the logic for this contract.
}
```

4.3 Inside the contract create the following variables
```solidity
// Max number of whitelisted addresses allowed to join the whitelist
uint256 public maxWhitelistedAddresses = 10;

// Create a mapping of whitelistedAddresses
// if an address is whitelisted, we would set it to true, it is false by default for all other addresses.
mapping(address => bool) public whitelistedAddresses;

// numAddressesWhitelisted would be used to keep track of how many addresses have been whitelisted
uint256 public numAddressesWhitelisted;
```

4.4 Next, create the addAddressToWhitelist function
```solidity
/**
addAddressToWhitelist - This function adds the address of the sender to the whitelist
*/
function addAddressToWhitelist() public {
 // check if the user has already been whitelisted
 require(!whitelistedAddresses[msg.sender], "Sender has already been whitelisted");
 
 // check if the numAddressesWhitelisted < maxWhitelistedAddresses, if not then throw an error.
 require(numAddressesWhitelisted < maxWhitelistedAddresses, "More addresses cant be added, limit reached");
 
 // Add the address which called the function to the whitelistedAddress array
 whitelistedAddresses[msg.sender] = true;
 
 // Increase the number of whitelisted addresses
 numAddressesWhitelisted += 1;
}
```
